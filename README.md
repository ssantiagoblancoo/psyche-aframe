# ${\textsf{\color{red} Welcome to the Psyche Mission }}$

Project 25-320 NASA [Psyche Mission](https://psyche.asu.edu/)

NASA and ASU are conducting research on a metal rich asteroid named “Psyche”
Because of the complexity of the information, we were tasked with creating WebXR and VR experiences to educate the public about the mission

Demo created with A-Frame

Deployed on Github pages: https://ssantiagoblancoo.github.io/psyche-aframe/

## Mission To Psyche:
AR/WebXR experience that puts you inside the spacecraft and shows you facts about the mission in an interactive way. User will be greeted with a title screen regarding the name of the mission, once they click on the screen they will be transported into the first WebXR screen in which they can read a summary of three major things regarding the mission: The Psyche Mission, The Asteroid, and The Spacecraft. After interacting with this screen user can click Explore Psyche Button, which will take them inside the spacecraft to read upon more detailed information regarding the mission. Interacting with objects inside the spacecraft will create an engaging learning experience towards the user.
