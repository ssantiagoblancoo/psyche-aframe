        <a-text value="NASA and ASU are conducting research on a metal rich asteroid named 'Psyche'\n
                      Because of the complexity of the information, we were tasked with creating WebXR and VR experiences to educate the public about the mission\n
                      We are choosing to use Unity to create WebXR/AR/VR experiences with different facts pulled from papers.\n
                      Our experiences include: a scavenger hunt and a game collecting meteoroids in the Psyche orbit in AR/WebXR, and 'Mission to Psyche' in VR which allows you to land on Psyche and explore the surface\n
                      scavenger hunt: collecting different items related to Psyche, such as asteroid, spacecraft, potentially one of the instruments used to measure Psyche, etc, This provides more in depth information on each part\n
                      game collecting meteoroids: players point their phone around to find a meteoroid and hit a button to collect the meteoroid, this provides fast facts on Psyche\n
                      'Mission to Psyche': Start on the rocket going to psyche with a date of arrival (of the spacecraft landing on Psyche), surface of the asteroid you can interact with the terrain, atmosphere, learning more about the mission\n
                      These experiences are to be used in museums and learning environments all around the world\n\n
                      Coming soon..."
